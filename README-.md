## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS


### What I learned

In this project I especially learned what is json file and how to use the data in json to use it in your javascript and update data accordingly.

Also I learned that if i ge stuck , I need to take a break and come back tomorrow and start again.

What helped in this is the use of Pseudocode. I wrote what i had to do in simple language than complicating it with code and i could do it much easily


### Useful resources

- [JSON Crash Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI1CWzNtE-M&t=1166s) - This helped me to understand the fundamentals of JSON 
- [Pseudocode] (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-problem-solving)- Helped me to brainstorm about the problem  to understand and how to solve it
